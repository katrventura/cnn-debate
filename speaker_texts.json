{"BIDEN": ["You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.\n     \n            We had an economy that was in freefall.

It\u2019d be all right.\n     \n            The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.\n     \n            And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u2019s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u2013 in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\n     \n            But there\u2019s more to be done. There\u2019s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.\n     \n            I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren\u2019t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.\n     \n            That\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u2019re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u2019re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u2019t take over.\n     \n            The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u2019re in this problem right now.\n     \n            In addition to that, we\u2019re in a situation where if you had \u2013 take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u2019t do much at all. By the time he left, there\u2019s \u2013 things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos.\n     \n            And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u2013 all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.\n     \n            And the situation is making \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans.

I don\u2019t know anybody else who thinks it was great \u2013 he had the greatest economy in the world.\n     \n            And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u2013 he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He\u2019s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.\n     \n            And the military \u2013 you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.
