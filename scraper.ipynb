It was terrible.\\n     \\n \\n            And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on – in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\\n     \\n \\n            But there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done.

No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug – all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.\\n     \\n \\n            And the situation is making – and we’re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans.
